I am an `Applied Researcher` at [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com/). I am currently training `on-prem LLMs` to integrate secure and cost-effective AI solutions with the [Webex AI Assistant](https://www.webex.com/ai-assistant.html).

My primary research interests lie in language and vision understanding. I work extensively in the field of `transfer learning`, `foundation models` and `representation learning`, with a focus on developing task-agnostic multi-modal architectures to advance understanding and reasoning capabilities in machines. 

I previously worked as an `Applied Research Scientist Intern` at [Intel](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/homepage.html) Research India, where I was advised by [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/) and [Anay Majee](http://anaymajee.me/) to develop various `attention mechanisms` for vision, aimed at autonomous driving in unconstrained traffic environments like India. 

Even earlier, I worked as an `Applied Research Intern` at the [Center for Cloud Computing & Big Data](https://research.pes.edu/cloud-computing-big-data/) during my undergraduate studies at [PES University](https://pes.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. KV Subramanium](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalsubra/) and worked on analysing tail latencies for latency-critical tasks ranging from language to vision.

You can read about my current and my published research on my [projects](/projects/) and [publications](/publications/) pages. I also write about relevant ideas and topics on my [blog](/blog/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
