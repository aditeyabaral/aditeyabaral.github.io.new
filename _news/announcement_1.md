Started working as an `Undergraduate Researcher` at the [Center for Cloud Computing & Big Data](https://research.pes.edu/cloud-computing-big-data/), PES University. I was advised by [Dr. KV Subramanium](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalsubra/) and worked on [`TailBench`](http://tailbench.csail.mit.edu/), a benchmarking suite to analyze the tail latencies of various applications across language and vision.
