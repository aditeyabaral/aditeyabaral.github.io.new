Started working as an `Applied Scientist Research Intern` at Intel Research, India. I was advised by [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/) and [Anay Majee](http://anaymajee.me/) to develop novel self-attentive and few-shot learning models for vision tasks aimed at autonomous driving in unconstrained traffic environments like India.
